# Sudoku Solver

This Python3 program will solve any given sudoku board and also prints it in a nice form before and after solving

# How to use this code?

The code is given both as a notebook(.ipynb) and a regular(.py) file.
- Open any one of the code files and scroll down till you see ***if \_\_name__ == '\_\_main__':***
- The variable ***start*** takes the sudoku board to be solved in the form of a _string_ with digits representing the value of the cell and dot(.) representing an empty cell

- The correct format of input to the ***start*** variable should consist of a concatenation of all the readings of the digits in the rows, taking the rows from top to bottom.

for example:

---
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zahash/ArtificialIntelligence/master/sudoku/sudoku_board.png)
---

will be written as '53..7....6..195....98....6.8...6...34..8.3..17...2...6.6....28....419..5....8..79'

# The HTML file

The project also contains a .html file which I didn't finish writing because I dont know much about HTML.
The idea behind that file is to provide a nice GUI to enter the sudoku board numbers in an interactive way and
also display the board after the program solves it. If anyone wants to create the GUI then feel free to make a 
pull request and contribute to the code base

# Conclusion

##### Run the code in your favourite Python IDE or sublime text to see the Sudoku board before and after it is solved
